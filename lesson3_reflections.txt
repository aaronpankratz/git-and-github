1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work with the public.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git were to automatically stay up-to-date then it may iterrupt the workflow of a user. The user would have to read all of the new commits whenever Git pulled them down and all of the context switching would be disruptive.
