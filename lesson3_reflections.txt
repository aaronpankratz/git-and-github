1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work with the public.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git were to automatically stay up-to-date then it may iterrupt the workflow of a user. The user would have to read all of the new commits whenever Git pulled them down and all of the context switching would be disruptive.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

The clone operation creates a local copy of a repository.
A branch creates a copy of the latest commit in a repository.
A fork creates a clone of a repository on github and links back to the repository being cloned from.
