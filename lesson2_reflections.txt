1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git metadata is created. We need to do this in order for git commands to work in the directory/repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is modified through git commands but the working directory can be modified by software that modifies the files and file system. It helps organize when you are building a commit by showing you what is and what is not currently staged for commit.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area provides a place to store your changes before you commit so that you can double check to ensure that your commit contains only one logical change.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When multiple developers are coding different features into a common code base. Branches allow each developer to commit changes in parallel and only require a merge or rebase of commits when they want to integrate back into the master branch.

 5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

With a diagram you can easily see all branches and all commit history in a tree representation.
